-Mince 6 cloves of Garlic and sweat (heat them up in a skillet)
-add 4 tablespoons Balsamic Vinegar
-add soy sauce to taste (DO NOT USE LOW SODIUM SAUCE)
-add 2 tablespoon Plum Sake (Drink additional 3 oz Plum Sake)
-Reduce sauce slightly (Drink additional 1.5 oz Plum Sake)
-3 1/2 tablespoons cock sauce (Sriracha)
-add 2 tablespoon brown sugar
-Red pepper flakes to taste
-Minced Ginger to taste
-Consume remaining Plum Sake

Simmer that shit for a solid 5 minutes, stirring pretty much constantly. The brown sugar helps it keep the proper consistency, so it’s important to use. Play around with the recipe to your taste. Might want more or less balsamic vinegar. Might want more or more Plum Sake. I’d definitely recommend you make it several times to figure out your own flavor.
